Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence : 

Given an Array:

create 2 more arrays of same size.

create two indices i & j.

for each value of j : iterate the part of the array which is left side of the index j.

for each i such that A[i] < A[j] : update the maxSum[j] = A[j]+maxSum[i]. While doing this also update maxSumIndex[j] = i;
