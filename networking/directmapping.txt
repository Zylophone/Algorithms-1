Direct mapping technique for Cache to Main Memory mapping.

Lets assume we have an n bits long address space for main memory.

Each main memory black has 2^m bytes.

Cache size 2^n bytes size. (n > m)

So total main memory blocks that the cache can hole = 2^n/2^m. So n-m bits can be used for indexing.

m bits are used for off-setting.

Rest of the bits are used for Tagging.
